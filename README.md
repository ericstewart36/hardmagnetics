# Magneto-viscoelastic snap-through modeling codebase

This repository contains the code base for the finite element implementation of the large deformation magneto-viscoelasticity theory I developed for modeling snap-through processes in bistable hard-magnetic soft-elastomeric actuators.

Specifically, the repository contains all the relevant FEniCS codes, mesh files, and experimental data files which were used in the calibration, prediction, and demonstration studies in the accompanying paper in _JMPS_, "Magneto-viscoelasticity of hard-magnetic soft-elastomers: Application to modeling the dynamic snap-through behavior of a bistable arch."

The mesh for the 3D hemispherical shell was generated using Abaqus and converted for use with FEniCS. I plan to soon publicly release a detailed instruction document on using Abaqus as a mesh generator for FEniCS.
